How to create ActorController
==============================

To control ActorAI, one has to create its own ActorController - a class inheriting from IActorController interface. For real usage, see TestActorController and StateMachineActorController.

Steps:
1. Create your controller class in new files (it is important that your class name ends with "ActorController")
2. Inherit it from IActorController and override pure virtual methods
3. Include your class header file in src/code/mkd/ActorControllerFactory.cpp
4. Add new entry for your controller in ActorControllerFactory::create - if your class name is MyTestActorController, your entry should be CREATE_CONTROLLER(MyTest)

Please note:
1. Actor can be controlled by only one controller at a time
2. Controller class headers should not be included anywhere outside ActorControllerFactory
3. Controllers shouldn't be istantiated explicitly, just use factory
4. When adding new compilation unit (.cpp file) it is required to include "pch.h" before anything else
