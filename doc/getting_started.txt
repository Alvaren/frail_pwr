1. Downloading FRAIL
FRAIL can be downloaded for free from [TU LINK DO DOWNLOADU]. One can download last stable release in simple ZIP package here: [LINK DO ZIPA], or clone git repository from here: [TU LINK DO REPO NA BITBUCKECIE].

After unpacking downloaded package or cloning repository, following directory structure can be found:
/
  /build  - working directory of FRAIL
  /src    - source directory for code and assets
  /doc    - documentation
  /tools  - useful tools for modifying FRAIL assets

2. Running simulation
FRAIL can be executed by using FRAIL Launcher in build/ directory - one can run it by double clicking build/Launcher_cmd.jar file. Java runtime is required.
[TU PODSUMOWANIE CO MOZNA ZROBIC W LAUNCHERZE]

Alternatively, FRAIL can be run with simple command line scripts, also placed in build/ directory. When starting FRAIL with scripts, map to be started has to be selected by passing its name through -level parameter. For example, running map arena_a can be achieved with following command executed inside build/ directory:
run_args.cmd -level arena_a

After starting FRAIL either way, user is asked for basic rendering parameters. One can change desired resolution, change mode to fullscreen, or disable antialiasing. Default values should be OK.
Remark: be sure to set "Floating-point mode:" option to "Consistent", if it has any other value. Simulation can run only with that setting.

Accepting selected rendering settings closes prompt window and starts simulation on selected level. 

3. Controlling simulation
User controls actor in simulation world, called Player. Player has the same capabilities as AI actors - it can walk, run, jump, attack with melee or range.
Controls scheme for player are as follows:
 - mouse movement - change looking direction; Player is observed through third person (TPP) camera
 - left mouse button click - melee attack
 - right mouse button click - ranged attack in direction pointed by camera
 - W - move forward (with respect to camera orientation)
 - A - move left (with respect to camera orientation)
 - S - move back (with respect to camera orientation)
 - D - move right (with respect to camera orientation)
 - space - jump
 - shift - sprint (use with WSAD)
 
One can also switch camera to 'freelook' mode, where camera isn't attached to player, and can move anywhere in the scene (player is constrained by collision and physics).
Switching to freelook mode is done with F2 key, returning to attached camera - with F3.

Other features of simulation control:
 - freeze simulation time - F9
 - unfreeze simulation time - F10
 - simulation speedup (10x) - F11
 - simulation speedup off - F12
 - show physics debug view - F5
 - hide physics debug view - Ctrl+F5
 - exit - Esc

4. Modifying simulation data
FRAIL enables simulation customization on following areas:
 - scripting in Lua
 - adding and modifying objects on levels by modifying simple JSON files or by sing specialized Blender plugin
 - modifying AI behavior by creating new or changing existing actor controllers

Last area requires writing code, and is covered in part 6. Creating custom AI behavior.

4.1 Lua Scripting
Most of "game-specific" behaviors of interactive objects in FRAIL are written in Lua scripts, and therefore easily moddable. FRAIL offers simple scripting environment, where each simulated object has its own scripting context, where functions and variables can be defined.

By defining functions with specific names (later called "Script Handlers"), one can change behavior of game object. Script Handlers are called from native FRAIL code when some event happens, eg. when new frame is started, or object is created. Here follows list of available Script Handler types:
 - onPostCreate - called once for object lifetime, after object is created
 - onDestroy - called once for object lifetime, just before object is destroyed; please note object can be destroyed by using DestroyObject function, or by simply unloading the level (and that happens when simulation ends)
 - onUpdate - called once per frame for every object; time intervals between every call vary, and can be obtained with GetTimeDelta function
 - onTakeDamage - called when scripted game object takes damage from any object
 - onTouched - called for objects of class VolumeTrigger (and subclasses), when other game object is inside its volume
 - onExploded - called when object of class ExplodingObject explodes
 
Scripts used by FRAIL can be found in build/data/scripts directory.

Actors' behavior can also be scripted. For more information see paragraph 6.2

4.2 Modifying levels
Levels description can be found in build/data/levels directory. Each level is defined in single .json file. Level format is simple - it's just collection of "game objects" - objects of classes implemented in FRAIL. For example, file:
[code]
{
    "StaticCollidableMesh" :
    {
        "m_meshName" : "arena_a.mesh"
    },
    
    "PlayerSpawner" :
    {
        "m_worldSpawnPos" : { 20.0, 2.0, 32.0 }
    },
    
    "AISpawner" :
    {
        "m_spawnOrigin" : { -30.0, 2.0, -20.0 },
        "m_spawnRadius" : 1.0,
        "m_aiNum" : 1,
        "m_presetName" : "AISandboxBoss"
    },
    
    "CylinderVolumeTrigger" :
	{
		"Preset" : "lava_lake_r4",
		"Name" : "lava_mid_lava_1",
		"m_worldTransform.position" : { -4.0, 0.0, 4.0 }
	}
}
[/code]
Defines level with 3 game objects - one of class "StaticCollidableMesh", which is used for collision tests and rendering, another of class "PlayerSpawner", which is responsible for creating ("spawning") Player in specified position, and another of class "AISpawner", responsible for creating m_aiNum=1 AIs of preset m_presetName=AISandboxBoss in random places within radius m_spawnRadius=1 meters around m_spawnOrigin.

Last object also defines its name - "lava_mid_lava_1" (objects can be referenced in Lua scripts by their names), and preset - "lava_lake_r4". Presets define default values for class fields - they're stored in data/presets directory, in JSON files,
one per class. Preset files are similar to level files.

New game object can be added by simply adding new entry to level file.

5. Compiling source code
Source code can be found in src/code/mkd/ directory. Visual C++ 2008 or higher is required to build FRAIL from source. To do that, one must:
 - open FRAIL solution - src/code/mkd/mkd.vcproj
 - build mkd project

FRAIL uses OGRE, bullet, vjson and LuaJIT.

6. Creating custom AI behavior
There are two ways of controlling AI behavior. More powerful is to create ActorController in native code. Simpler, second one is to create Lua script. Both ways are covered below.

6.1 Native
Class responsible for simulating AI-controlled actor is ActorAI. It exposes simple interface through which one can control it, with no boilerplate code needed.
To control ActorAI, one has to create its own ActorController - a class inheriting from IActorController interface. For real usage, see TestActorController and StateMachineActorController.

Steps:
    1. Create your controller class in new files (it is important that your class name ends with "ActorController")
    2. Inherit it from IActorController and override pure virtual methods
    3. Include your class header file in src/code/mkd/ActorControllerFactory.cpp
    4. Add new entry for your controller in ActorControllerFactory::create - if your class name is MyTestActorController, your entry should be CREATE_CONTROLLER(MyTest)

Please note:
    1. Actor can be controlled by only one controller at a time
    2. Controller class headers should not be included anywhere outside ActorControllerFactory
    3. Controllers shouldn't be istantiated explicitly, just use factory
    4. When adding new compilation unit (.cpp file) it is required to include "pch.h" before anything else
    5. Controllers are not GameObjects, and do not use FRAIL RTTI - so they cannot be created on level and do not use presets

6.2 Scripts
Example of scripted AI is on scripted_ai_test level. Steps:
    1. In AISpawner, specify m_presetName as AIScripted and m_overrideScriptName as path to your script relative to build/data/scripts.
       Alternatively, you can use different preset already specifying script name. It is important that used preset does *not* specify actor controller name!
    2. Provide onPostCreate, onUpdate, onDebugDraw and onTakeDamage script handlers
