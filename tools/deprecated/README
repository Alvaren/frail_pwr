Deprecated tools, not used anymore. Scripts contain relative paths to src and build directories,
so if for some reason you'd like to run these tools, move them back to "tools" directory, for example:

 tools/deprecated/compile_prefabs.sh -> tools/compile_prefabs.sh
 tools/deprecated/maze_gen/gen_level_mesh.sh -> tools/maze_gen/gen_level_mesh.sh

or just fix all relative paths
